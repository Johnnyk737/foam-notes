# Fundamentals

Design interview is intentionally vague. It's your job to take the two-word sentence and turn it into 45 min interview. asking important questions like
- What type of system we're building
- What type of functionality are we aiming for
- What characteristics are valued in the system

Unlike coding interviews, System interviews are a lot more subjective. It's your job to justify your solution and eliminate the interviewer's doubts. This will be difficult to do without the fundamentals.

## What are the Fundamentals
They can be bucketed into 4 different categories
 - Underlying/Foundational Knowledge
   - If you don't understand this, you will have gaps and will be unable to defend your views. (i.e. client-server model, network protocols)
 - Key characteristics
   - Things you want the system to have, or tradeoffs. (i.e. availability, redundancy, latency)
 - Components of a System
   - Things that you can implement in a system (i.e. load balancers, caches, proxies, rate-limiting)
 - Actual Tech
   - Real tools that allow you to implement your system (i.e. nginx, zookeeper, redis, AWS S3)
